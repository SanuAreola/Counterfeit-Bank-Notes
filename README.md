This is a solution to my final exam for my IGAD certification and it solves the question below


Machine Learning Project: Bank Note Authentication
Objective:
Develop a machine learning model to accurately classify whether a banknote is authentic, or counterfeit based on various extracted features.
Dataset:
The Bank Note Authentication dataset contains measurements of various physical properties of banknotes. Each banknote has been classified as either authentic or counterfeit.
Dataset Features:
variance: Variance of the wavelet-transformed image.
skewness: Skewness of the wavelet-transformed image.
kurtosis: Kurtosis of the wavelet-transformed image.
entropy: Entropy of the image.
Target Variable:
class: 0 indicates a counterfeit banknote, 1 indicates an authentic banknote.

Tasks:
Data Exploration:
i.	Load the dataset and display the first few rows.
Hint:
 columns = ["variance", "skewness", "kurtosis", "entropy", "class"]
variable name for your dataset = pd.read_csv(r'path_to_bank_note_dataset.csv',header=None, names=columns)
ii.	Perform basic statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
iii.	Visualize the distribution of each feature and the class balance.

Data Preprocessing:
i.	Check for and handle any missing values.
ii.	Scale/normalize the feature values if necessary.
iii.	Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70% training, 30% testing).

Model Development:
i.	Choose at least two different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, etc.).
ii.	Train the models on the training set.
iii.	Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Model Evaluation:
i.	Compare the performance of different models using a confusion matrix.
ii.	Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model based on their performance metrics.
Model Optimization:
i.	Perform hyperparameter tuning for at least one of the models to improve performance.
ii.	Use techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search.

Conclusion:
i.	Summarize your findings and the performance of the models.
ii.	Provide insights into which model is more suitable for this task and why.
iii.	Discuss any potential improvements or future work that could be done.

Feature Importance:
i.	Analyse and discuss the importance of each feature in the best-performing model.
Cross-Validation:
i.	Perform k-fold cross-validation on the best-performing model and report the results.
Deployment Considerations:
i.	Discuss how you would deploy this model in a real-world banking environment.
ii.	Address any ethical concerns or potential biases in the model.
